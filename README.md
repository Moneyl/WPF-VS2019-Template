# WPF VS Theme Template
A template project for WPF with a theme mimicking VS2019. Uses MahApps MetroWindow beta. Will later add some other variants like one with a basic ReactiveUI/MVVM setup and ones targeting .NET Core 3.0.

# Examples
An example of a project using a slight variant this is [OGE](https://github.com/Moneyl/OGE), seen below. Note that it's also using AvalonDock for docking. That's not included with this template.
